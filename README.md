# KNEX-Experience-Overview
About the Role  
**Product Intern** (Mar 2025 – Aug 2025)  
- Worked directly with the CEO and product team on **AI-driven product development, product strategy, and data management initiatives**.  
- Contributed to **roadmap structuring, PRD documentation, feature prioritization, and AI integration research** across multiple KNEX products.

##  Key Responsibilities  
- Built a **universal product prioritization framework** in Excel, aligned with Oracle-style decision-making, designed for reusability across all KNEX products.  
- Designed a **roadmap methodology** based on Oracle’s 3-tier structure (Plan of Record, Plan of Intent, Plan of Direction).  
- Conducted **AI feasibility studies** for KNEX products, producing actionable recommendations.  
- Evaluated **Oracle Fusion’s data migration limitations** and developed mitigation strategies for unified reporting.  
- Restructured PRDs to be **platform-agnostic**, drawing inspiration from Jira/Confluence best practices.

##  Projects & Contributions  

### 1. Universal Product Prioritization Framework  

I created a **universal framework in Excel** that could be reused across all KNEX products. The main goal was to make prioritization **objective, structured, and easy to communicate**. To achieve that, I combined multiple well-known models instead of relying on just one. Each model added its own perspective:  

- **ESVF (Effort, Strategic Value, Financial Impact, Feasibility):**  
  - Helped us score features on a balanced scale.  
  - Forced us to ask: *How much effort does this take? Does it tie to company strategy? What’s the financial upside? Is it feasible right now?*  
  - Provided a **numeric, comparable score** for each feature.  

- **MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have):**  
  - Added **clarity for stakeholders**.  
  - Instead of only numbers, features could be grouped into simple buckets.  
  - Great for conversations with leadership when we needed a **quick, intuitive prioritization lens**.  

- **RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed):**  
  - Solved the **ownership gap** that often blocks execution.  
  - Made it clear *who drives what*.  
  - Helped track dependencies and accountability across teams.  

 **Why combine them?**  
Because in real-world product management, no single framework tells the whole story.  
- ESVF gave us the **quantitative backbone**.  
- MoSCoW gave us a **fast, intuitive lens**.  
- RACI ensured the plan was **practical and executable** by the team.  

The outcome was a framework that felt **well-rounded, transparent, and actionable** — one that made decision-making smoother both internally (execution teams) and externally (stakeholders).

### 2. Roadmap Methodology & Execution Sheet  

####  Roadmap Methodology  
- Developed a **structured methodology** to translate prioritized feature lists into product roadmaps.  
- Adopted **Oracle’s 3-level roadmap structure** for external communication:  
  - *Plan of Record* → Immediate release  
  - *Plan of Intent* → Next release  
  - *Plan of Direction* → Long-term vision  
- Ensured clarity, intentionality, and stakeholder alignment in roadmap design.
- Also, added  external facing aspect to the doc to share it to the stakeholders/clients.

####  Roadmap Execution Sheet (Internal Use)  
- Created a **companion Excel sheet** for **internal roadmap execution and tracking**.  
- Provided step-by-step workflows so product teams could move from **roadmap → execution** smoothly.  
- Integrated:  
  - **Feature status tracking** (planned, in-progress, released)  
  - **Cross-team dependencies**  
  - **Release timelines & milestones**  
  - **Ownership & accountability**  
- Outcome: Enabled a **smoother process flow** for the internal team, reducing ambiguity and ensuring seamless delivery of roadmap items.

### 3. Tools & Confluence PRD – Product Management Enablement Plan  

I created a **Product Management Enablement Plan** focused on building a clear, repeatable PRD system for KNEX. The goal was to make documentation not just a formality, but an **enabler of smoother execution and stronger alignment**.  

####  What We Did  
- Drew inspiration from **Jira/Confluence best practices**, but built everything inside KNEX’s context and tools (no external platform used).  
- Designed a **modular PRD template** that works across all KNEX products, including:  
  - Problem & business context  
  - User stories and acceptance criteria  
  - Dependencies and risks  
  - Success metrics  
  - Decision log for key choices  
- Developed a **step-by-step enablement guide** so teams knew not just *what to write*, but *why it mattered*.  

####  How We Did It  
- Reviewed gaps in existing documentation.  
- Drafted the PRD pack, then tested it live with product discussions.  
- Took feedback from leadership and PMs, simplifying where things were too heavy and adding clarity where needed.  
- Connected the PRD pack with the **roadmap execution sheet**, so specs flowed naturally into delivery.  

####  Why It Worked  
- **Unified:** every product team worked with the same approach.  
- **Adoptable:** lightweight enough that people actually used it.  
- **Traceable:** tied strategy → roadmap → execution in one flow.  
- **Scalable:** reusable across all future KNEX products.  

The outcome was a PRD system that **reduced confusion, improved accountability, and made product management more effective across KNEX**.

### 4. AI Integration Research & Recommendations  
- **Lease Abstraction Agent (LAA):** Automated lease data extraction  
- **AI Load Checker:** System load monitoring + optimization signals  
- **Inventory Flow Agent:** Tracking + forecasting improvements  
- **Unified Dashboard:** Cross-product insights for leadership  
- Kept ideas **practical and cost-aware**, focusing on measurable impact.

### 5. Oracle Fusion Data Migration Study  
- Noted limits (e.g., partial historical migration) → data split between **KTH (pre-go-live)** and **Oracle (post-go-live)**.  
- Proposed **transaction duplication into KTH** for unified reporting and easier analytics access.
